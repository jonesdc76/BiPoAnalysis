\section{Plot Description}
\subsection{Description of BiPo events in the AD}
There are two IBD-like ``BiPo" backgrounds in the PROSPECT data so termed because they come from decays of bismuth followed by polonium. Because these time-correlated decays are $\beta$-decay followed by $\alpha$-decay they have a topology similar to our IBD events. 
\begin{itemize}
\item{$^{214}\textrm{Bi}\rightarrow^{214}\textrm{Po}\rightarrow^{210}\textrm{Pb}$, the dominant decay seen, and arises from $^{222}$Rn, the ubiquitous radioactive gas from the $^{238}$U decay chain. The half life of $^{222}$Rn is 3.8 days, so a gas-tight detector would see this signal decay away within a few weeks. On the other hand, a detector such as ours is not gas-tight, so we do not expect this BiPo signal to completely disappear. The half-life of $^{214}\textrm{Po}$ is 0.1643(20)~ms giving us a beta followed by an alpha much like the IBD signal. $^{214}\textrm{Bi}$ beta decays 99.98\% of the time with a Q-value of 3.275(15)~MeV. This beta decay only goes to the daughter ground state about 19\% of the time with the remaining 81\% of beta decays having an accompanying gamma ranging in energy from 0.6~MeV to 2.7~MeV (there are a number of decays above this even as high as 3.18~MeV but they occur very rarely). 99.99\% of the time $^{214}$Po alpha decays with a kinetic energy of 7.687~MeV which is quenched to about 0.84~MeV in our detector. }
\item{$^{212}\textrm{Bi}\rightarrow^{212}\textrm{Po}\rightarrow^{208}\textrm{Pb}$ is from the $^{232}$Th decay chain which also has a radon daughter $^{220}$Rn. The half life of $^{220}$Rn is only 56 s, making it much less likely to permeate from external sources. However, given the universal presence of trace radioactive elements like $^{232}$Th, it is not surprising that we would see this decay uniformly throughout our detector. The half-life of $^{212}\textrm{Po}$ is 299(2)~ns. $^{212}\textrm{Bi}$ beta decays 64\% of the time with a Q-value of 2.2515(17)~MeV. This beta decay goes to the daughter ground state about 91\% of the time with the remaining 9\% of beta decays having an accompanying gamma ranging in energy from 0.7~MeV to 1.8~MeV. The  $^{212}\textrm{Po}$ alpha decays 100\% of the time with a kinetic energy of 8.785~MeV which is quenched to about 1.06~MeV in our detector. The short half life of this decay makes it more difficult to measure given that a typical waveform is $\sim$600~ns long, but provides a signal with little accidental background. Due to its short half life, our efficiency for detecting this decay is rather low.}
\end{itemize}

Since these decays are an IBD-like background, they need to be measured and leakage into our IBD selection quantified. In practice, given the high energy resolution of our detector ($\sim5\%/\sqrt{\textrm{MeV}}$), the alpha peaks from these events are well separated from the neutron capture peak near 0.53~MeV.

In principle, a uniformly dissolved source such as trace $^{232}$Th giving a signature decay sequence can be used to monitor relative cell volumes assuming that rate is proportional to volume. However, our low detection efficiency for the $^{212}$Bi$\rightarrow^{212}$Po decay combined with the already trace amount present in our detector gives a detection rate per cell of less than one decay per hour. A 1\% measure of relative cell volumes with this decay rate would require 1-2 years of data.

This study focuses on using the nearly monoenergetic alphas from these decays to measure the stability of the energy calibration, PSD and the position and energy resolution of the AD. 

\subsection{Plots details}
The following list of plots will be made for both the decays of $^{214}\textrm{Bi}\rightarrow^{214}\textrm{Po}\rightarrow^{210}\textrm{Pb}$ and $^{212}\textrm{Bi}\rightarrow^{212}\textrm{Po}\rightarrow^{208}\textrm{Pb}$. Any plots involving alpha energy will be shown in reconstructed energy and ``smeared" reconstructed energy. Smeared reconstructed energy is an attempt to give all cells of the detector nearly the same energy resolution constant over time. The energy resolution is not identical segment to segment and is also degrading nearly linearly with time. Smeared energy adds a random noise that is segment and time dependent intended to produce a uniform energy resolution across all cells that does not change much with time. The energy resolution of the worst cells towards the end of the given analysis period then set the resolution of the full detector. For this analysis pass 2018A, the target resolution was 400 PE/MeV or approximately 5\% at 1 MeV. Beta energy is not smeared in these plots since beta's are not used in the stability plots for this analysis.
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Alpha mean energy and smeared energy vs. segment.}
\item{Width (1$\sigma$) of the alpha energy distribution and the smeared alpha energy distribution vs. segment.}
\item{Width (1$\sigma$) of the $\Delta$Z distribution, separation distance between the alpha and beta vs. segment. This is a measure of the position resolution.}
\item{RMS width of the Z-position distribution of alphas vs cell.}
\item{Alpha mean energy and smeared alpha mean energy versus time. Ideally, this should be statistically consistent with a constant.}
\item{Alpha mean energy width and smeared alpha mean energy width versus time. This will track detector light yield and transport.}
\item{RMS width of the Z-distribution of alphas averaged across detector versus time. This shows the stability of the position reconstruction over time.}
\item{Width of $\Delta$Z distribution averaged across detector versus time. This tracks the position resolution over time.}
\item{Mean of the Z-position distribution of alphas vs cell. This will be a verification that the position reconstruction is working as expected and should be statistically distributed around zero.}
\item{Alpha energy and smeared alpha energy distribution for whole detector. This will be used to estimate leakage into IBD event selection.}
\item{Beta energy spectrum for whole detector. The shape and endpoint is to be compared with a simulated spectrum to verify that the simulation properly captures the detector performance. }
\item{Whole detector Po alpha Z-position distribution.}
\item{Whole detector $\Delta$Z-position distribution.}
\end{enumerate}
Each plot consists of events that are selected by their time-correlation and as a result, each has an accidental component that must be subtracted. Accidental subtraction is performed using a time offset window. For both alpha decays the offset window starts 10$\times\tau_{214}\approx2.4~ms$ forward from the alpha. The length of the accidentals offset window is set to be 12 times the length of the window for the prompt signal to accumulate more statistics. The accidentals histogram is then scaled by 1/12 to account for this. Other than the timing differences, the signals in the accidentals window are treated exactly the same as those in the prompt window, being subjected to identical cuts and conditions.

\subsection{Message being conveyed by the plots}
The position and energy resolution plots are for monitoring the detector performance and light collection by cell and over time. To a lesser extent these will also be sensitive to wrong calibration values/curves. The alpha energy of the Po-212 decay is quenched from 8.79~MeV to 1.06~MeV in our detector and the Po-214 alpha is quenched from 7.69~MeV to 0.84~MeV. The energy and Z-width plots will be used to monitor the effectiveness of the calibration to remove time-dependent and segment-to-segment variations. The alpha energy spectra will be used to quantify leakage into the IBD selections. The Po-212 beta spectrum has an endpoint of 2.25~MeV and the Po-214 beta spectrum has an endpoint of 3.27~MeV. The beta spectra will be used to benchmark and test simulation.

A good runs list was generated for this release and can be found on the Github repository  \href{https://github.com/PROSPECT-collaboration/PROSPECT2x_Analysis/tree/master/Analysis/AnalyzerConfig/NuFact18\_GoodRuns\_RxStat.txt}{here} under the 2018A\_Extra\_Phys release. All files included in the good runs are in this data set. There were no analysis failures reported.
\subsection{Location of data}
The PhysPulse .h5 files used to make this plot at the time of this writing are stored on borax.llnl.gov. Running the BiPoTreePlugin over these data files will produce a TTree of BiPo events for each run. 

\section{Event selection and cuts\label{sec:cuts}}
This section deals with the cuts applied to the data to obtain the final event selection. Loose cuts were applied at the plugin-level to limit the size of the event trees. More restrictive cuts were then applied to this event selection in the analysis code that utilized these event trees. The plugin-level cuts were broad enough to include both isotopes of polonium. Some of the more restrictive analysis cuts were isotope-specific.
\subsection{Plugin-level cuts}
The following list of 32 segments were excluded from the analysis inside the BiPoTreePlugin using the ``exclude" feature in the configuration file: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 18, 21, 23, 27, 31, 32, 34, 41, 44, 48, 52, 56, 63, 69, 79, 86, 87, 115, 122, 127, and 139. No fiducial cuts were applied to the data either at the cell level or in z-position.
Table \ref{tab:plugincuts} summarizes the cuts made at the plugin level for creating the BiPo event trees.
\begin{table}

\end{center}
\end{table}
\subsection{Analysis-level cuts}
More restrictive cuts were applied in the analysis code running over these event trees, some of which were dependent upon the polonium isotope being plotted.
Although the code is set up to handle fiducial cuts, neither $z$ nor cell-wise fiducial cuts were applied in this analysis. Table \ref{tab:analysiscuts} summarizes the cuts applied at the analysis level.

\end{table}

Figures \ref{fig:apsd212} and \ref{fig:apsd214} show the PSD selection for the delayed alphas. The full energy range covering the alphas in both decay chains is included.
It is worth noting that with the exception of $E_{tot}$, the total cluster energy, information for the prompt cluster (PSD, position, energy etc) refer only to the maximum energy event in the cluster. Therefore, further cuts on these quantities on the prompt beta are limited to the maximum energy event in the prompt cluster. In addition to the parameters of the maximum event, the displacement of the prompt event furthest away from the delayed alpha is also saved as the ``max\_dist" variable. There was no obvious place to cut on this variable so no cut on ``max\_dist" was applied. Figures \ref{fig:bpsd212} and \ref{fig:bpsd214} show the PSD and energy selection for the prompt betas. 
However, a cut on prompt/delayed displacement (where prompt position is the position of the maximum prompt event) did prove fruitful in reducing background. The prompt/delayed displacement $d$ is calculated as follows:
\[
d=\sqrt{(\Delta n_x\times 146~\textrm{mm})^2+(\Delta n_y\times146~\textrm{mm})^2 + \Delta z^2},
\]
where $n_x(y)$ is the displacment in the x(y) direction between the prompt and delayed events measured in number of cells. Figure \ref{fig:deltaD} shows the distribution of prompt/delay displacements. A cut was placed at $d<700$~mm.

\end{figure}

The half-life of the $^{214}$Po decay is 0.1643~ms. The time difference between the prompt beta and delayed alpha candidates for this decay is limited to 0.01~ms$<$dt$<3\times\tau$ where $\tau=0.1643/\textrm{ln}(2)$~ms, the lifetime of $^{214}$Po. Figure \ref{fig:dt214} show the $\Delta$t distribution. A fit to the half-life of $^{214}$Po is in good agreement with the accepted value.

The half-life of the $^{212}$Po decay is 299~ns. The time difference between the prompt beta and delayed alpha candidates for this decay is limited to 250~ns$<$dt$<250~\mu$s. The time distribution (see Figure \ref{fig:dt212}) below 650~ns is shaped by artifacts of the length of the waveforms and an analysis hold off time.  A fit to the half-life of $^{212}$Po is in good agreement with the accepted value. Only the data from 660~ns upward is used in the half-life fit. However, the result of the fit is extended (dashed line) over the whole data set to justify the use of data outside this region. The entire data set from 0.25~$\mu$s to 2.5~$\mu$s is used in this analysis. 

Accidental subtraction is performed using a time offset window. For both alpha decays the offset window starts 10$\times\tau_{214}\approx2.4~ms$ forward from the alpha. The length of the accidentals offset window is set to be 12 times the length of the window for the prompt signal to accumulate more statistics. The accidentals histogram is then scaled by 1/12 to account for this. Other than the timing differences, the signals in the accidentals window are treated exactly the same as those in the prompt window, being subjected to exactly the same cuts and conditions.

The delayed monoenergetic alpha was limited to a single segment event, while the prompt beta with potentially high energy correlated gammas was allowed to fire multiple cells. A broad multiplicity cut was applied in the BiPoTreePlugin to limit the number of segments hit in the prompt event to less than 20. In the language of P2X prompt cluster multiplicity was limited to a size of 20 events or fewer.

\section{Software}
These plots were produced in a two step sequence. First, a TTree of BiPo candidates was produced for each run using the plugin framework from P2X. The plugin is called BiPoTreePlugin which lives in the PhysPulse directory. PhysPulse plugins operate on calibrated data, that is, data where pulse energy is calibrated to remove position dependence and where timing offsets due to hardware configurations and cable lengths have been removed. The cuts applied at the plugin level are relatively loose to allow for studies with restricting cuts later. Second, two programs are called to run over the BiPo TTrees and make the plots. The plots of variables such as energy and resolution versus time are made using the program ``BiPovsTime.C". The remaining plots that are averages over all time are made using ``BiPoPlotter.C".  Both of these ROOT macros use the same set of cuts on the data. See Sec. \ref{sec:cuts} for information on the cuts applied. For information on obtaining or viewing this code from the Github see Sec. \ref{sec:github} 
\subsection{Code used to generate plots}
The code required to do this analysis is all available on the Github (see Sec \ref{sec:github}). Production of the BiPo TTrees requires a working version of P2X. 
To build the BiPo TTrees run the script runBiPoTTreePlugin.sh
To plot results run BiPovsTime.C and BiPoPlotter.C from inside a ROOT terminal.
